## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "recONRzIUTuZ5lXaF",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Liz Yrineo",
        "setup": "Why did the tomato turn red?",
        "punchline": "Because it saw the salad dressing!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "rec3oYZ5Tp0AIDsKe",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Rachel Moskowitz",
        "setup": "What did the green grape say to the red grape?",
        "punchline": "Breathe, idiot, breathe!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Gary Grant",
        "setup": "How do you make holy water?",
        "punchline": "You boil the hell out of it!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "offset": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features._

- Find and use external api
- Render data on page
- Allow user to choose their character/fighter (2 options)
- Have an opponent for the fight
- have a dice mechanic in the game
- have a randomized dice mechanic for the opponent.

#### PostMVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features._

- Add more character options for the player
- have more than one opponent that is randomly chosen to challenge the player
- have a way for the player to create their own character to play with
- Make the player characters and opponents more complex with attributes that can add modifiers to the dice rolls
- Add a way for players to level up and more difficult opponents for them to face.
- create a narrative element to multiple battles to make the game more immersive.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

| Day    | Deliverable                                        | Status     |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Jan 9  | Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete |
| Jan 10 | Project Approval                                   | Incomplete |
| Jan 11 | Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.)       | Incomplete |
| Jan 14 | Pseudocode / actual code                           | Incomplete |
| Jan 15 | Initial Clickable Model                            | Incomplete |
| Jan 16 | MVP                                                | Incomplete |
| Jan 17 | Presentations                                      | Incomplete |

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I'm really excited about my project idea! I've been itching to get into creating games and I'm excited to use React to finally do it. Over the past two class days I really began to understand React and I'm eager to use what I've learned to create not only a require project but one I would consider a passion project.

### Weaknesses:

I have never tried dice mechanics. I have no idea how to implement a way to have a randomly generated dice roll just yet. I've taken on some challenges that I will have to research how to do.

### Opportunities:

This is a great opportunity to get my feet wet with creating game systems. I already enjoy writing and creating TTRPGs in my free time and I've been wanting to be able to program modules for the various game ideas my husband and I have. I think I can use this project as a starting point to have a template to create more complex applications for passions projects I already have ideas for.

### Threats:

I'm taking on a more complex project this time than I did for my first project. I'm going to be attempting to do some code that I have not learned yet. I tend to procrastinate so it will be a challenge to manage my time in such a way that I am not franatically finishing up this project at the last minute.
