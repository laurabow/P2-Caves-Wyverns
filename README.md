## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I'm really excited about my project idea! I've been itching to get into creating games and I'm excited to use React to finally do it. Over the past two class days I really began to understand React and I'm eager to use what I've learned to create not only a require project but one I would consider a passion project.

### Weaknesses:

I have never tried dice mechanics. I have no idea how to implement a way to have a randomly generated dice roll just yet. I've taken on some challenges that I will have to research how to do.

### Opportunities:

This is a great opportunity to get my feet wet with creating game systems. I already enjoy writing and creating TTRPGs in my free time and I've been wanting to be able to program modules for the various game ideas my husband and I have. I think I can use this project as a starting point to have a template to create more complex applications for passions projects I already have ideas for.

### Threats:

I'm taking on a more complex project this time than I did for my first project. I'm going to be attempting to do some code that I have not learned yet. I tend to procrastinate so it will be a challenge to manage my time in such a way that I am not franatically finishing up this project at the last minute.
